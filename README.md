# Landing-Page

## Description
This project is a simple landing page built using HTML and CSS. The goal was to practice structuring a full webpage from scratch, working with headers, sections, buttons and placeholders for images. The project served as practice for layout design, Flexbox, and applying multiple styles consistently across a web page.

## Functionality
The page contains multiple sections including a hero section with a title, subtext, and call-to-action button, a content section with images and subtext, a quote section and a footer. 

## Technical Approach
I focused on building the structure first with semantic HTML, then styling using CSS and Flexbox to align content. This project improved my understanding of positioning elements, spacing, and styling text and buttons. I also practiced integrating fonts from Google Fonts and setting up a consistent color scheme across the site.

## Running the Project
